My Why

So every year I get handed dozens of IEP files that I have to pore over for hours by hand and get the important information I need by hand. 

This is 2025. Back to the Future said we would have flying cars by 2015 and we're 10 years past that. 

We've had AI for about 3 years or so now and I don't understand why I am doing this stuff by hand. 

It's frustrating and time consuming and there has to be a better way. So I'm going to see if AI can do it for me. 

I know that I have to be very careful of FERPA, so I will not include any Personally Identifying Information (PII), but only the accommodations page(s) from IEPs 

to see if AI can take care of the manual portion for me.

P.S. I'm sure there's a better way to write this out, and I will eventually learn. Please forgive my mistakes as I learn.
