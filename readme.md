Prompt Writing Project

I’m learning how to write prompts for AI. I started this in August 2025.

I don’t really know what I’m doing yet. I’m just saving my first tries so I can look back later and see if they get better.

Right now I have Day 1 in here. I’ll keep adding more when I make them.

I’m also learning GitHub at the same time, so this repo might look messy for a while until I figure out how to do things the “right” way. Right now I know that GitHub is a place where I can save multiple versions, but that each one is not its own file. 

This might not be the way other people do it, but it’s how I’m starting. Please forgive my mistakes as I learn.
