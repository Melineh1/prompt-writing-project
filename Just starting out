This is going to be my log as I go. I think I can just update this one file as I go. I guess I will just date the entries to keep them separate? I really don't know.

Today I tried to use AI to read through student accommodations and compile them all into one big excel file. I worked on it for hours. I think I did it correctly. I'm waiting for the last thing to finish. Had to switch from Copilot to ChatGPT because Copilot was frustrating me.

I donâ€™t know if I can recreate the whole process again. I need to figure out how to save the exact instruction set so I can repeat it later, because right now it feels like I just got lucky.
