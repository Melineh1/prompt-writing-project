This is going to be my log as I go. I think I can just update this one file as I go. I guess I will just date the entries to keep them separate? I really don't know.

Today I tried to use AI to read through student accommodations and compile them all into one big excel file. I worked on it for hours. I think I did it correctly. I'm waiting for the last thing to finish. Had to switch from Copilot to ChatGPT because Copilot was frustrating me.

I don’t know if I can recreate the whole process again. I need to figure out how to save the exact instruction set so I can repeat it later, because right now it feels like I just got lucky.

Notes about Copilot: it was frustrating to use and seems to forget/not follow instructions often. Had to repeat myself often. Will figure out why and how to say things once. 

Once I got ChatGTP to produce the excel chart (after about 5 hours of trying) it told me that this is the instruction set I need to tell it next time:

Standing Instruction Set for Accommodation Charts

Upload student accommodation screenshots one at a time (cropped for clarity) or paste text.

Read every accommodation exactly as written.

Always mark Copy of Notes (Hard/Electronic) if “copy of notes” appears in any form.

Merge “Small Group” into Small-Group Test.

Two-row headers: Category (row 1) → Accommodation (row 2).

First two columns: Class Period, Student.

Students alphabetized within each period; columns alphabetized within each category.

Keep all categories:

Adapt Classroom Instruction

Adapted or Additional Materials

Alter Assignments or Testing

Alter Testing

Required Equipment/AT

Manage Behavior

Environmental/Accessibility

Academic Interventions

Content & Language Supports

Add new accommodations as new columns under the correct category.

Triple-check: every student has all accommodations marked; Copy of Notes never missed; no blank unused categories.

Provide inline preview for verification before exporting.

Export as downloadable Excel (.xlsx) with two-row headers, and optionally CSV.

Use version numbers in filenames (e.g., Master_Accommodations_All_v11.xlsx).
